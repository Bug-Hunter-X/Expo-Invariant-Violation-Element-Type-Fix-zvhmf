# Expo Invariant Violation: Element type is invalid

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Expo projects:  'Invariant Violation: Element type is invalid'. This error typically arises from using unsupported native modules or incorrect project setup within the Expo managed workflow.

## Problem
The `Invariant Violation: Element type is invalid` error in Expo often indicates an incompatibility between the code attempting to render a component and the Expo environment (especially within Expo Go).  This frequently occurs when modules requiring native platform access are used without proper configuration or alternatives.

## Solution
The solution depends on the root cause.  This repo illustrates a common scenario and its resolution.  The key is to either:

1. **Replace the unsupported module:** Use a compatible Expo-supported alternative or find an equivalent within the Expo ecosystem.
2. **Correct project configuration:** Ensure all dependencies are properly installed and configured according to Expo's guidelines.

## How to reproduce (bug.js)
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
// Simulate attempting to use an unsupported module
import { UnsupportedComponent } from './unsupported-module'; // This file does not exist, simulating the error

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Expo App</Text>
      {/* This will cause the error */}      <UnsupportedComponent />
    </View>
  );
}
```
