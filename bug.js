This error typically occurs when you try to import a module that Expo doesn't support or that isn't properly installed.  For example, if you import a native module that requires platform-specific code (like accessing the device's camera), you might encounter this error in the Expo Go app because it runs in a sandboxed environment.  Another cause could be incorrect configuration of your project, missing dependencies, or version mismatches between Expo modules.

Example (Illustrative):
```javascript
import { someNativeModule } from 'some-native-module'; // This module might not be available in Expo Go
```
