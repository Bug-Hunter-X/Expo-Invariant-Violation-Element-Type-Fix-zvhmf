To fix this, remove or replace the unsupported module.  If you were actually using a native module, you would look for an Expo-compatible alternative or adjust your app to work within Expo's managed workflow.  Here's how to solve it if the problem were caused by the example in `bug.js`:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Expo App - Error Resolved</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

Remember to adjust the solution based on your specific use case. If the error persists, review the Expo documentation, check your package.json, and ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and configured.
